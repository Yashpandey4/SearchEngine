Another way of storing data is in a stack. A stack is generally implemented with only two principle operations (apart from a constructor and destructor methods):
push	adds an item to a stack
pop	extracts the most recently pushed item from the stack
Other methods such as
top	returns the item at the top without removing it 
isempty	determines whether the stack has anything in it

A common model of a stack is a plate or coin stacker. Plates are "pushed" onto to the top and "popped" off the top.
